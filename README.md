# Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification Implementation

Implementation of the ["Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) paper. The data was scraped from the ["Rotten Tomato"](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) website that can be found [here.](https://github.com/RezuwanHassan262/Universal-Language-Model-Fine-tuning-for-Text-Classification-Implementation/blob/main/data/film_details.csv)

I also tried out a few transformer architecture-based pre-trained language models like Distilroberta, Alberta, Bert and Xlnet etc.
